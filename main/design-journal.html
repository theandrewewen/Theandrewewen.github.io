        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a coheisive design across the project? How will your color pallette, imagery, and typeography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: Im choosing to do a series of chile peppers. The back ground color will change from chile to chile, but the text and image locations will stay (at least for now).A bold sanserif seems fitting for the subject matter, however i havnt settled on one yet. </p>

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>Prompt: This week’s journal prompt, I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website.Once you've imagined this person. write about them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it</p>
        <p>Response: I imagine a user of my Chile website to not have too much existing knowledge of chiles. I want the user to be able to enjoy the information presented but also have some sence of exploration and discovery. I plan on encorporating some aspect of turning cards over, or sliding pages to promote this idea. 
          Additionally I would thikn the user is partially acatter brained as most of us are nowdays. With that in mind I want my experience to be shaped with ease of use in focus.  </p>

        <h2>Week Six</h2>
        <p>Prompt:Why did you choose the business/cause that you chose? Why do you think your redesign will be better? What area/content will you focus on in your redesign? Look at two other similar websites. What stands out about those sites? What bothers you about them? How will you improve things in your own design?</p>
        <p>Response: I chose Ben Davis because the website didnt have that much content, and I figured it would be easy. I dont think my redesign will be better, honestly Im having a hard time creating designs that I like through the HTML frame work. I find that im much more efficient when able to express ideas though visual means rather than algorithmic. If i were to choose a differnt path I would have gone with a more light hearted website that had more creative directions to go with the rebrand.</p>

        <h2>Week Eight</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Why be a designer? what compels you?</p>
        <p>Response: Creation has alwasy been a means of escape for me. The feeling of being somewhere else while complety engaged in an activity is soemthing of a drive for me. I prefeer art over design any day, it was only after years of study did I realise the differences and my missalignment to my goals. I do not want to be a graphic desginer. I would much rather be a sound engeneer or producer for rap beats. However I chose the wrong college and now it looks like i need to finish what I started. </p>
